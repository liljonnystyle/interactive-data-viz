# CSS Animations

This exercise focuses on creating expressive, responsive, and understandable buttons. There are three components to think about with this exercise:

* Basic CSS styling to make the div look like a button
* Hover behavior to provide user feedback
* A selected state that differs from the hover state.

I've provided a basic template with one pair of buttons written in HTML, basic CSS styling, and a function that adds a ```.selected``` class when a button is clicked.

## Goals:

1. Pick at least three attributes from [Animatable](http://leaverou.github.io/animatable/) and replicate them in your own CSS. 
2. Write different styles for ```:hover``` and ```.selected``` states in each case
3. Animate your ```:hover``` changes with CSS animations, and write each of the animations in both [```transition:```](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp) and [```@keyframes```](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_animation-keyframes.asp) notation.

## If you're feeling saucy:

1. Try building more elaborate button styles, like a [pill button group](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#btn-groups-single) or [tabs](http://css-tricks.com/functional-css-tabs-revisited/).
2. Write some JS code such that only one button in a pair can be selected at a time.
